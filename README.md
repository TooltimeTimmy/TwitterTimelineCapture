3. **Open the Cookie Editor**: Once logged in, click on the cookie editor extension icon.

4. **Export Cookies**:
    - In the cookie editor, find an option to export or copy all cookies to clipboard.
    - Copy the cookies.

5. **Create a JSON File**: 
    - Open a text editor and paste the copied cookies.
    - Save this file as `cookies.json` in the same directory as the script.
